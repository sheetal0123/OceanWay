#Clean Coding:
- The best place to make local variable is where we have to use them. Shd have min scope.
- Try to use for-each loop over normal for loop and iterator to iterate an array or collection.
	for-each has many adv specially in case of nested loops.
- Never use float and double to money related calculation. Use BigDecimal.
- Always try to use Primitive over Boxed Primitive(Integer,Long,Boolean etc) wherever possible
- A utility class should always have a private constructor, so that no object can be created in class.
- A utility class should not have any class level variables, all variables should be local to methods otherwise it can impact other codes.
- Extract code to new a new method if code is getting longer than 4-5 lines
- Important method should have bare mini code, all other code shd extract to new method
- method name is very imp and shd suite to particular functionality
- Any user defined constant or string shd be made as constant with proper meaningful name

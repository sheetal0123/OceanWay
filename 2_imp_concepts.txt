#Imp Notes:
- The obj who invokes equals(overridden case) method is actually passed into equals(calling obj) e.g. CompareListOfObj.java






#Internal working of HashMap
1. As per Key, Hashcode get calculated and Key get stored in respective Bucket ID.
2. Within same Bucket ID, Linked List get implemented



#Internal working of HashSet
1. HashSet implements HashMap Internally
2. Whenever we call hs.add(), it calls hm.put("key",Object CONSTENT);
3. As HashMap can store only unique Key, hence Set contains only unique Keys



#Internal working of ArrayList
1. ArrayList has two overloaded method add(object) & add(int index, Object)
2. Default add() method adds element at the end of AL, the other one at specified index
3. Capacity:
   List al = new ArrayList();  // Create space of 10
   List al = new ArrayList(count);  // space of given count
4. Dynamically grows
   If AL is full and we added a new value. Then it create a new AL with more space.
   inside .add() method we have a method ensureCapacity() which keep a watch on current AL size.

#Clean Coding:
- The best place to make local variable is where we have to use them. Shd have min scope.
- Try to use for-each loop over normal for loop and iterator to iterate an array or collection.
	for-each has many adv specially in case of nested loops.
- Never use float and double to money related calculation. Use BigDecimal.
- Always try to use Primitive over Boxed Primitive(Integer,Long,Boolean etc) wherever possible
-
